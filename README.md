# nodejs3dprintercam
Follow my 3D printings and make timelaps of my printings

It's a set of tools more than a shiny application

raspberry/linux :
- bash script to retrieve cam pictures (using fswebcam)
- bash script to make a video from pictures (using mencoder)
cross platform :
- nodejs webserver app to serve a basic html and printing image
- nodejs commandline app to get the image for the timelaps
